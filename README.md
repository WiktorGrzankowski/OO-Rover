# OO-Rover
This program simulates behaviour of a space rover. It is written using object-oriented programming,
including polymorphism, abstract and virtual classes and more features such as smart pointers. 
The rover itself is built using a helper Builder class which is an implementation of the factory pattern method.
rover_example.cc provided shows how a Rover can be built using method chaining, as well as
how it behaves on calling certain methods.
